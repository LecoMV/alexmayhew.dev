## TL;DR

Fractional CTO for: Pre-seed through Series A, teams under 10 engineers, when you need strategic guidance more than daily management. Full-time CTO for: Series B+, teams over 15, when technology is your core differentiator and you need someone thinking about it 24/7. The transition point is usually $5-10M ARR or 15+ engineers—whichever comes first.

## The Real Cost Comparison

Let's do the math that founders often skip.

### Full-Time CTO Total Cost

| Component                    | Annual Cost             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Base salary                  | $200-350K               |
| Equity (1-3% over 4 years)   | $25-75K/year equivalent |
| Benefits, taxes, overhead    | $40-70K                 |
| Recruiting (if using a firm) | $50-100K one-time       |
| **Total Year 1**             | **$315-595K**           |

And that's if you hire correctly the first time. A bad CTO hire costs 6-12 months of runway plus the damage to your engineering culture.

### Fractional CTO Total Cost

| Engagement Level            | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Advisory (4-8 hrs/month)    | $2-5K        | $24-60K     |
| Part-time (20-40 hrs/month) | $8-15K       | $96-180K    |
| Interim (near full-time)    | $20-30K      | $240-360K   |

No equity. No benefits. No recruiting risk. Flexible engagement.

The math isn't even close at the early stages. But cost isn't the only factor.

## When Fractional CTO Makes Sense

### 1. Pre-Seed Through Series A

You don't have 40 hours of CTO-level work per week. You need strategic decisions made correctly, not someone sitting in Zoom calls.

**What you actually need:**

- Architecture decisions that won't haunt you at scale
- Technology selection with long-term implications
- Hiring your first 3-5 engineers
- Code review and quality standards
- Investor pitch technical credibility

A fractional CTO handles all of this in 8-20 hours per month. The rest of the time, your team executes.

### 2. Non-Technical Founders

If neither founder has deep technical experience, you need technical leadership—but not necessarily full-time.

**The fractional CTO provides:**

- Translation between business goals and technical reality
- Vendor and contractor evaluation
- Technical due diligence protection
- Roadmap prioritization
- Build vs. buy decisions

This is guidance, not execution. You don't need 40 hours/week of guidance.

### 3. Stable Product, Growth Phase

Your core product works. You're scaling sales, not rebuilding the architecture. Engineering is maintenance and incremental features.

**A fractional CTO can:**

- Review major architectural decisions
- Interview and evaluate engineering hires
- Provide escalation path for technical debates
- Keep technical debt from accumulating
- Advise on scaling infrastructure

The day-to-day is handled by your senior engineers. The CTO layer is strategic.

### 4. Bridge to Full-Time Hire

You know you need a full-time CTO eventually. But the hiring process takes 3-6 months. A fractional CTO bridges the gap.

**This is especially useful when:**

- Your current CTO is leaving
- You're preparing for a major fundraise
- You have enterprise deals requiring technical leadership
- Your engineering team is growing past self-organization

---

## When Full-Time CTO Makes Sense

### 1. Technology Is Your Core Differentiator

If you're building AI infrastructure, developer tools, or deep-tech, your CTO needs to be obsessing over the technology 24/7.

**Signs technology is your moat:**

- Your product is technically novel (not a better UX on existing patterns)
- Your engineering challenges are research-grade
- Competitors can't replicate your tech easily
- Patents or proprietary algorithms are central to value

A fractional CTO can't provide the depth of focus these challenges require.

### 2. Engineering Team Over 15

At 15+ engineers, you need:

- Multiple team leads and managers
- Organizational design and career paths
- Culture and retention strategy
- Cross-team coordination
- Performance management

This is a full-time job. Actually, it's more than full-time.

The fractional model breaks down because the management overhead exceeds the strategic contribution.

### 3. Series B+ Fundraising

Investors at Series B and beyond expect a full executive team. A fractional CTO signals you're not ready to scale.

**What investors want to see:**

- Technical leader with skin in the game (equity)
- Long-term commitment to the company
- Someone accountable for engineering execution
- Board-level technical representation

A fractional CTO can help you get to Series A. For B and beyond, you need the real thing.

### 4. Enterprise Sales Requiring Technical Leadership

Enterprise customers want to meet your CTO. They want to discuss roadmap, security, and integration with someone who will be there in 3 years.

**A fractional CTO struggles with:**

- Multi-day customer on-sites
- Ongoing relationship with customer technical teams
- Long-term roadmap commitments
- Security and compliance attestations requiring executive sign-off

The commitment signals matter as much as the technical substance.

## The Hybrid Model

Many startups I advise use a hybrid approach:

**Phase 1: Fractional CTO (Pre-seed to Seed)**

- 8-16 hours/month
- Architecture, hiring, strategy
- $3-8K/month

**Phase 2: Fractional CTO + VP Engineering (Seed to Series A)**

- Fractional CTO: Strategic, 8 hours/month
- VP Eng (full-time): Execution, team management
- Total: $15-25K/month + VP salary

**Phase 3: Full-Time CTO (Series A+)**

- Transition fractional to advisory or exit
- Full-time CTO owns everything
- VP Eng reports to CTO

This model delays the expensive, risky CTO hire until you actually need it—and until you have the resources to get it right.

## What to Look for in a Fractional CTO

Not all fractional CTOs are equal. Here's what separates good from great.

### Must Have

**1. Operating experience at your target scale**

If you're aiming for Series B, your fractional CTO should have taken a company past Series B. Theory doesn't help.

**2. Technical depth in your domain**

A fractional CTO from e-commerce won't help a biotech startup. Domain matters.

**3. Communication skills**

They're translating between technical and business. If they can't explain complex trade-offs simply, they'll create confusion, not clarity.

**4. Network for hiring**

A good fractional CTO brings access to engineers. Their Rolodex is part of the value.

### Red Flags

**1. Only wants to write code**

A fractional CTO who wants to be an IC isn't a CTO. You need strategic leadership, not another developer.

**2. One-size-fits-all recommendations**

Every startup hears "use Kubernetes" or "migrate to microservices." A good fractional CTO understands your context and recommends accordingly.

**3. Can't explain their track record**

Ask about failures. Everyone has them. If they can't discuss what went wrong and what they learned, they're not self-aware enough to guide your decisions.

**4. Wants equity immediately**

Fractional CTOs get paid in cash. Equity is for full-time commitment. If they want equity from day one, they're either planning to transition to full-time (fine, discuss it) or trying to capture upside without the commitment (not fine).

## Structuring the Engagement

### Scope Definition

Be explicit about what's included and what's not.

**Typical fractional CTO scope:**

- Weekly 1:1 with CEO/founder
- Architecture review and decisions
- Technical hiring interviews
- Code review for critical components
- Vendor evaluation
- Investor pitch preparation

**Typically NOT included:**

- Day-to-day engineering management
- Individual contributor coding
- Customer support escalations
- HR issues beyond hiring

### Time Commitment

Set expectations clearly:

- **Advisory**: 4-8 hours/month, asynchronous + one call
- **Part-time**: 10-20 hours/month, regular office hours
- **Active**: 20-40 hours/month, embedded in team

Start with advisory. Increase if needed. It's easier to scale up than to reduce scope.

### Communication Cadence

What works:

- Weekly 30-60 minute sync with founder
- Slack/email access for async questions
- Monthly engineering team session
- Quarterly roadmap review

What doesn't work:

- Expecting instant responses to every question
- Daily standups (defeats the purpose of fractional)
- Decision paralysis waiting for CTO input

The fractional CTO provides direction. Your team should be able to execute without daily hand-holding.

### Deliverables

Define what "success" looks like:

| Area         | Deliverable                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Architecture | Documented tech stack decisions       |
| Hiring       | Interview rubric, first 3 hires       |
| Process      | CI/CD pipeline, code review standards |
| Strategy     | 12-month technical roadmap            |
| Fundraising  | Technical due diligence prep          |

Tie payment to outcomes where possible. Hours worked is an input metric, not an output metric.

## Making the Transition to Full-Time

When it's time to hire a full-time CTO, the fractional CTO can help:

### 1. Define the Role

The fractional CTO knows what work actually needs to happen. They can write a realistic job description, not a wish list.

### 2. Source Candidates

Their network is your recruiting pipeline. A recommendation from a trusted advisor beats a LinkedIn InMail.

### 3. Interview and Evaluate

Technical interviews are hard to do well. The fractional CTO knows what questions reveal true capability vs. rehearsed answers.

### 4. Transition Knowledge

Six months of decisions need to transfer. The fractional CTO can document architecture decisions, technical debt, and landmines.

### 5. Advisory Board Seat

After transitioning out, many fractional CTOs become formal advisors. Their context is valuable for the new CTO.

## The Numbers That Matter

### When to Start Looking for Full-Time CTO

| Signal                | Threshold                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Engineering team size | 12-15 engineers                |
| Annual revenue        | $5-10M ARR                     |
| Funding stage         | Series A closed or B planned   |
| CTO hours needed      | >30/week consistently          |
| Strategic vs tactical | Less than 30% time on strategy |

If you're hitting multiple thresholds, start the search. It takes 3-6 months to hire a good CTO.

### Fractional CTO ROI

The value is hard to quantify but real:

- Architecture mistake avoided: $100K-$1M in refactoring
- Bad hire prevented: $200K in salary + 6 months lost
- Enterprise deal enabled: $50-500K ARR
- Fundraise premium: 10-20% higher valuation with technical credibility

At $5-15K/month, the ROI is obvious if even one of these happens.

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Before deciding, answer honestly:

**1. How many hours of CTO-level work do we have per week?**

Not engineering work. Strategy, architecture, hiring, vendor decisions. If it's under 20 hours, fractional makes sense.

**2. What's our runway?**

A full-time CTO costs $25-50K/month fully loaded. At 18 months runway, that's 15-30% of your burn. Is that the best use of capital?

**3. Is technology our core differentiator?**

If yes, full-time CTO earlier. If no (you're innovating on business model, not technology), fractional longer.

**4. Can we hire a good CTO right now?**

Great CTOs are hard to find. If you can't attract the caliber you need with your current traction, use a fractional CTO until you can.

**5. What does our board expect?**

If investors are pushing for a full-time CTO, understand why. Sometimes it's valid. Sometimes it's pattern matching.

```

Most startups should start fractional. The question is when to transition, not whether to.

**Considering a fractional CTO engagement?** I work with seed-stage through Series A startups as a technical advisor—providing architecture guidance, hiring support, and strategic direction without the full-time commitment. If you're not sure whether you need fractional or full-time technical leadership, that's usually a sign you need fractional first.

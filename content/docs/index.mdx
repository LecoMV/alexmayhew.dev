description: Technical documentation and guides for projects and tools.
---

Welcome to the documentation hub. Here you'll find technical guides, API references, and implementation details for various projects.

## Getting Started

This documentation covers:

- **Architecture patterns** used in production projects
- **Code examples** with detailed explanations
- **Best practices** for modern web development
- **Tool configurations** and setup guides

## Quick Links

- [Architecture Overview](/docs/architecture) - System design principles
- [API Reference](/docs/api) - Endpoint documentation
- [Setup Guides](/docs/guides) - Step-by-step tutorials

## Philosophy

All documentation follows the same principles as the code itself:

1. **Clarity over brevity** - Explain the why, not just the what
2. **Real examples** - No abstract snippets, only production-tested code
3. **Progressive disclosure** - Start simple, add depth as needed

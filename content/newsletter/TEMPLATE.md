Subject: [Specific hook — max 60 chars]

Hey {first_name},

[Personal hook — 2-3 sentences grounding this week's theme in a real scenario a CTO faces. Be specific about the company stage, team size, or revenue context. No generic openers.]

---

## This Week's Decision

**The Situation:**
[Relatable scenario with specific business context — revenue stage, team size, growth rate. The reader should think "that's exactly where I am."]

**The Insight:**
[200-300 words. Lead with the non-obvious conclusion. Include at least one specific metric. Back claims with advisory experience, not theory. Add a code example if it clarifies the point. Every sentence must earn its place — cut anything that doesn't add information.]

```typescript
// Real variable names. Real patterns.
// Brief — illustrate the concept, don't build a tutorial.
```

**When to Apply This:**

- [Specific criterion tied to ARR range or team size — e.g., "Pre-Series A, under $500K ARR"]
- [Specific criterion tied to technical state — e.g., "Traffic under 10K RPM"]
- [Specific criterion tied to organizational stage — e.g., "Engineering team under 15 people"]

## Worth Your Time

1. **[Article Title](url)** — [50-word original take. Not a summary — your perspective on why this matters, where you agree or disagree, and who should read it.]

2. **[Article Title](url)** — [50-word original take. Connect to this week's theme or a broader pattern you've observed in advisory work.]

3. **[Article Title](url)** — [50-word original take. Bonus if it's contrarian to the main insight — show you can hold nuance.]

---

## Tool of the Week

**[Tool Name](url)** — [50-100 words. What problem it solves, when to reach for it, and why now. If you've used it in a client engagement, say so. If there's a caveat, include it — credibility comes from honesty.]

---

That's it for this week.

Hit reply if [specific question about this week's topic — make it concrete and answerable]. I read every response.

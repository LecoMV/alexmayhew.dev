Subject: The $2.4M cost of "we'll fix it later"

Hey there,

"We know it's messy, but it works." I hear this sentence at least twice a month from CTOs who are about to learn what "works" actually costs them.

The problem with technical debt isn't the code. It's that nobody quantifies it, so it never wins budget against feature work.

## This Week's Decision

**The Situation:**
Your engineering team moves slower every quarter. PRs that took 2 hours now take 6. Onboarding new engineers takes 3 months instead of 3 weeks. Everyone knows the codebase has problems, but leadership won't approve a "refactor sprint" without a business case.

**The Insight:**
I've developed a friction tax calculation that turns vague complaints into dollar figures. I've used it with 8 teams, and the number always shocks leadership into action.

Here's the formula:

```
Friction Tax Calculator:
────────────────────────
Team size:                    12 engineers
Average fully-loaded comp:    $200,000/year ($100/hour)
Hours per week per engineer:  40

Friction sources:
  Extra time per PR (review + rework):     +2.5 hours/PR
  PRs per engineer per week:               3
  Extra debugging time per incident:       +4 hours
  Incidents per month:                     6
  Extra onboarding time per hire:          +160 hours (4 weeks)
  Hires per year:                          4

Annual friction cost:
  PR overhead:    12 × 3 × 2.5 × 52 × $100  = $468,000
  Incident cost:  6 × 4 × 12 × $100          = $28,800
  Onboarding:     4 × 160 × $100             = $64,000
                                    ─────────────────────
  Total annual friction tax:                   $560,800
  5-year cost at current trajectory:          $2,804,000
```

That $2.8M makes the business case for a 3-month refactor involving 3 engineers ($150,000 fully loaded). The ROI is 18:1 over 5 years, even assuming the refactor only reduces friction by 50%.

The key insight: tech debt doesn't compound linearly. It compounds exponentially because each new feature built on a fragile foundation adds more coupling, more edge cases, and more "don't touch that" tribal knowledge. A team with 20% friction tax this year will have 30-35% next year if they keep building on the same foundation.

One client measured their PR cycle time monthly. In January: 4.2 hours average. By September: 11.8 hours. Same team, same sprint velocity targets — they just spent 3x longer on each unit of work.

**When to Apply This:**
- Engineering teams where PR cycle time has increased more than 50% over 6 months
- Companies spending over $150K/year on engineering compensation per person (the friction tax scales with compensation)
- Organizations where onboarding takes more than 6 weeks to first meaningful PR

## Worth Your Time

1. **[Stripe: Paying Down Tech Debt](https://stripe.com/blog/payment-api-design)** — Stripe's approach to API design prevents debt accumulation. Their backward-compatibility strategy means they rarely need large refactors. The lesson: design decisions that prevent debt are cheaper than any cleanup effort.

2. **[Chelsea Troy: Quantifying Technical Debt](https://chelseatroy.com/2021/01/14/quantifying-technical-debt/)** — The best framework I've found for measuring tech debt beyond code quality metrics. Troy focuses on developer throughput impact, which is what actually affects the business.

3. **[Google: Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book)** — Chapter 15 covers deprecation and large-scale changes. Google's approach to maintaining a 2-billion-line codebase offers patterns for managing debt at any scale. The key: automated tooling for refactors, not heroic manual efforts.

## Tool of the Week

**[LinearB](https://linearb.io/)** — Measures cycle time, review time, and deployment frequency from your Git data. The dashboard makes friction visible to non-technical stakeholders. I recommend it specifically for building the business case — showing leadership a graph of PR cycle time trending upward is more persuasive than any slide deck.

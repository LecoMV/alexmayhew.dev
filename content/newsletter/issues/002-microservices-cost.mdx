Subject: The 73% overhead nobody warns you about

Hey there,

Last week I shared why your SaaS needs a monolith first. This week, the other side: what microservices actually cost when you adopt them too early. Not the AWS bill — the costs that don't show up on any dashboard.

---

## This Week's Decision

**The Situation:**
Your engineering team pushes for microservices because "Netflix does it." Leadership wants to know the real cost before approving.

**The Insight:**
Across the startups I've advised, premature microservices adoption follows a predictable cost pattern. I call it the TCO Triangle — three categories of overhead that compound:

**1. Infrastructure Tax (30-40% of codebase)**

```yaml
# What "simple" microservices actually require
services:
  - api-gateway # Route and authenticate requests
  - auth-service # JWT/session management
  - user-service # User CRUD and profiles
  - billing-service # Stripe integration
  - notification-svc # Email, push, webhooks

infrastructure:
  - consul # Service discovery
  - envoy # Service mesh / sidecar proxy
  - jaeger # Distributed tracing
  - prometheus # Metrics collection
  - grafana # Dashboards and alerting
  - elasticsearch # Log aggregation
  - kafka # Event streaming between services
```

Count them. 12 systems before you ship a single business feature.

**2. Cognitive Load Tax (2-3x debugging time)**
A bug in a monolith: read the stack trace, find the function, fix it.

A bug across services: correlate trace IDs across 4 services, check 3 log streams, reproduce timing-dependent failures. The median debugging session goes from 30 minutes to 90+ minutes.

**3. Hiring Tax ($50-100K/year additional)**
You need at least one infrastructure-focused engineer to maintain the platform. At seed stage, that's 20-25% of your engineering headcount dedicated to keeping the lights on, not building product.

**The Team-Size Breakpoint Framework:**

| Team Size | Architecture            | Rationale                            |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Under 10  | Monolith                | One team, one codebase, one deploy   |
| 10-30     | Monolith + 1-3 services | Extract only different scaling needs |
| 30-50     | Domain-aligned services | Team boundaries match service bounds |
| 50+       | Microservices           | Headcount absorbs operational cost   |

**When to Apply This:**

- Under $1M ARR with fewer than 10 engineers — the monolith is your competitive advantage, not your technical debt
- $1-5M ARR — audit your services, calculate your infrastructure-to-feature ratio, and consolidate if it exceeds 30%
- $5M+ ARR — now microservices earn their operational cost, but only where team boundaries genuinely require independent deployment

## Worth Your Time

1. **[Martin Fowler: Monolith First](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html)** — Fowler's argument has a nuance most people miss: you can't draw service boundaries correctly until you understand the domain. Starting with a monolith is how you learn where the real seams are.

2. **[Shopify's Modular Monolith](https://shopify.engineering/shopify-monolith)** — Shopify processes $7.5B+ in GMV on a Rails monolith. Componentized modules within a single deployment — Black Friday at scale, one pipeline.

3. **[Local-First Software](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/)** — A paradigm that sidesteps the distributed systems question entirely. Worth understanding as the complexity pendulum swings back toward simplicity.

## Tool of the Week

**[k6](https://k6.io/)** — Before you add horizontal scaling, know your actual limits. k6 lets you write load tests in JavaScript, and the results consistently surprise teams: most well-tuned monoliths on a single beefy server handle 5-10x the traffic founders assume. Start with `k6 run --vus 100 --duration 30s` against your staging environment and see where you actually stand.

That's it for this week.

Hit reply if you've calculated your infrastructure-to-feature ratio. I'm curious what number you're at. I read every response.

P.S. Last week's issue on [why monoliths win at early stage](https://alexmayhew.dev/blog/saas-architecture-decision-framework) pairs well with this one — the decision framework for when to actually make the switch.

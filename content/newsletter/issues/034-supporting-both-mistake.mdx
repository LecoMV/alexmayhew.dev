Subject: The $200K/year "we support both" mistake

Hey there,

"We support both REST and GraphQL." "We maintain both the legacy Angular app and the new React app." "We run on both AWS and GCP." Every time I hear "we support both," I see a team burning money to avoid making a decision.

The cost of "both" is never what teams expect.

## This Week's Decision

**The Situation:**
Your company acquired a product running on a different tech stack. Or sales promised a customer REST when you're a GraphQL shop. Or the team couldn't agree on a framework, so both factions got what they wanted. Now you maintain two of something, and it's slowly draining your engineering capacity.

**The Insight:**
I've calculated the cost of "both" across 7 teams. The formula is straightforward, and the number is always higher than leadership expects:

```
Cost of "Both" Calculator:
──────────────────────────
Context switching overhead per PR:     +1.5 hours
  (two codebases, two patterns, two mental models)
PRs per engineer per week:             3
Engineers working across both:         8
Weekly switching cost:                 36 hours

Duplicate infrastructure maintenance:  +10 hours/week
  (two CI pipelines, two dependency sets, two security audit surfaces)

Knowledge fragmentation:               +5 hours/week
  (bugs in system A require system B context, or vice versa)

Total weekly cost: 51 hours × $100/hour = $5,100/week

Annual cost: $265,200

For a team that could consolidate in a
3-month project (3 engineers × 3 months):  $150,000

Break-even: 7 months
ROI over 3 years: 5.3x
```

Why "both" happens and how to counter each argument:

**"Sales promised it."** Response: calculate the cost of the promise. If maintaining a second API surface costs $200K/year and the deal is worth $80K/year, the math doesn't work. Present the data to sales leadership.

**"We acquired it."** Response: set a sunset date before the acquisition closes. The integration plan should include a migration timeline. Every month without a plan makes the migration more expensive.

**"The team couldn't agree."** Response: this is a leadership failure, not a technical problem. Make the decision. The cost of maintaining two approaches always exceeds the cost of one team being unhappy for a month.

**"We need it for backward compatibility."** Response: this is the only valid reason, and it still has a deadline. Set a deprecation timeline with version support windows. Communicate it to customers. The cost of perpetual backward compatibility is often higher than the cost of migrating customers.

The decision-making framework: for every "we support both" situation, answer three questions. What is the annual maintenance cost? What is the one-time migration cost? What is the break-even timeline? If break-even is under 18 months, migrate. If it's over 18 months, schedule the migration for the next major version or product cycle.

**When to Apply This:**
- Teams maintaining two versions of a system, two API paradigms, or two deployment targets
- Post-acquisition integration where "keep both" has become the default
- Any situation where "supporting both" was a temporary compromise that became permanent

## Worth Your Time

1. **[Basecamp: Choose Boring Technology](https://boringtechnology.club/)** — Dan McKinley's original argument for limiting technology choices. His "innovation tokens" concept applies directly to the "both" problem: every additional technology you support spends a token you can't use on product innovation.

2. **[Shopify: Monorepo Migration](https://shopify.engineering/shopify-monorepo)** — Shopify consolidated from multiple repositories and tech stacks into a monorepo. Their migration story quantifies the before/after: deployment frequency doubled, onboarding time halved, and cross-team collaboration became possible without context switching.

3. **[Martin Fowler: Strangler Fig Pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html)** — If you decide to migrate away from "both," the strangler fig pattern is the lowest-risk approach. Route traffic incrementally from the old system to the new one. Fowler's description remains the clearest explanation of how to execute a gradual migration without a rewrite.

## Tool of the Week

**[Backstage](https://backstage.io/)** — Spotify's developer portal. If you're stuck supporting "both" during a transition period, Backstage provides a unified catalog of all services regardless of tech stack. It won't reduce the cost of "both," but it makes the fragmentation visible — which is the first step toward building the case for consolidation.

That's it for this week.

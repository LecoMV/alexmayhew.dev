Subject: The 3 signals you need a Staff Engineer

Hey there,

A CTO called me last month after their third failed Staff Engineer hire. Each candidate was technically brilliant. Each left within 6 months. The problem wasn't the candidates — it was the job description. They hired for deep technical expertise when they needed someone who could align 4 teams around a platform migration.

The Staff Engineer role is the most misunderstood title in engineering.

## This Week's Decision

**The Situation:**
Your company is at $3-8M ARR with 15-30 engineers across 3-5 teams. Technical decisions are getting made in silos. Architecture is diverging. You're hearing "we need a Staff Engineer" from multiple directions.

**The Insight:**
Three signals tell you it's time:

1. **Cross-team technical decisions stall for weeks.** Teams can't agree on shared patterns, and no one has the authority or context to break ties. You, the CTO, are the bottleneck for every architectural question.

2. **Your best senior engineers are solving the same problems differently across teams.** Three teams, three caching strategies, three deployment patterns. Not because the problems are different, but because nobody owns the horizontal view.

3. **You're spending more than 30% of your time on technical decisions instead of organizational strategy.** A Staff Engineer takes the technical decision load so you can focus on hiring, process, and business alignment.

The interview process that works: skip the algorithmic coding challenge entirely. Use these instead:

**The Architecture Review Exercise:** Give candidates a real (anonymized) system from your codebase. Ask them to identify the top 3 risks and propose a migration path. You're evaluating communication clarity and trade-off reasoning, not whether they pick the "right" architecture.

**The Cross-Team Influence Question:** "Tell me about a time you changed a technical direction across multiple teams that initially disagreed with you." Listen for: stakeholder mapping, coalition building, written proposals, and measured outcomes. If they can only describe solo technical achievements, they're a Senior Engineer, not a Staff Engineer.

**Reference Checks That Matter:** Ask former managers: "Did this person make other engineers more effective, or were they a solo contributor with a senior title?" The answer separates Staff Engineers from Senior Engineers who got promoted for tenure.

2026 compensation benchmarks for Staff Engineers at Series A-C SaaS companies: $220-320K base + $80-200K equity (4-year vest). Remote roles trend 10-15% lower. The market has cooled from 2024 peaks but Staff-level talent remains competitive.

**When to Apply This:**
- Companies with 15+ engineers where technical coordination problems are visible
- CTOs spending more than 30% of time on architectural decisions
- Organizations where cross-team projects consistently miss deadlines due to integration issues

## Worth Your Time

1. **[Will Larson: Staff Engineer](https://staffeng.com/)** — The definitive resource on Staff Engineering archetypes. Larson identifies four types: Tech Lead, Architect, Solver, and Right Hand. Knowing which archetype you need prevents the "brilliant but wrong fit" hire that keeps happening.

2. **[Tanya Reilly: Being Glue](https://noidea.dog/glue)** — The work that Staff Engineers do — documentation, alignment, mentoring — is often invisible. Reilly's talk explains why this "glue work" is the actual job, and why organizations that don't value it can't retain Staff Engineers.

3. **[Gergely Orosz: Compensation Trends](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/)** — Orosz publishes the most reliable compensation data for senior IC roles. His 2026 surveys show Staff Engineer comp stabilizing after 2 years of compression. Essential reading before setting your offer range.

## Tool of the Week

**[Ashby](https://www.ashby.com/)** — An ATS built for engineering hiring. The structured interview scorecards and calibration features prevent the "gut feel" hiring that leads to Staff Engineer mis-hires. I've seen teams using Ashby's interview analytics identify which interview stages actually predict job performance — for most, the architecture exercise correlates 3x higher than coding challenges.

That's it for this week.

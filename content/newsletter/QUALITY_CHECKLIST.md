## Content Quality

- [ ] Contains at least one specific metric or number (not "many" or "a lot")
- [ ] Every technical point ties to a business outcome (revenue, time, cost, risk)
- [ ] At least one contrarian or non-obvious insight
- [ ] Code examples use real variable and function names (never `foo`, `bar`, `baz`)
- [ ] Decision framework is stage-specific (ARR range, team size, or growth stage)
- [ ] "Worth Your Time" links have original takes, not summaries or reworded abstracts
- [ ] Tool of the Week is something you would actually recommend to a paying client

---

## Voice Check

- [ ] No hedging language ("perhaps", "maybe", "might want to", "could potentially")
- [ ] No marketing buzzwords ("game-changer", "revolutionary", "cutting-edge", "next-level")
- [ ] No emojis in body text
- [ ] No exclamation points (max 1 in the entire email, and only if genuinely warranted)
- [ ] No filler phrases ("in today's world", "as we all know", "it goes without saying")
- [ ] Short paragraphs (max 3 sentences each)
- [ ] Reads like advice to a founder you talked to this week — not a blog post

---

## Technical Quality

- [ ] Subject line under 60 characters
- [ ] Total word count between 500 and 700 words (4-5 minute read)
- [ ] All external links verified working (click each one)
- [ ] Code blocks render correctly in Markdown preview
- [ ] No code blocks wider than 60 characters (mobile-safe)
- [ ] No tables wider than 600px
- [ ] Mobile preview checked — readable without horizontal scrolling

---

## Structure Check

- [ ] Opens with a specific scenario, not a generic statement
- [ ] "The Insight" section leads with the conclusion, then supports it
- [ ] "When to Apply" has exactly 3 bullets, each with a measurable criterion
- [ ] "Worth Your Time" has exactly 3 links with original commentary
- [ ] "Tool of the Week" section is present and substantive
- [ ] Sign-off includes a concrete reply prompt (not "let me know your thoughts")
- [ ] P.S. links to a relevant blog post or resource

---

## Pre-Send Final Check

- [ ] Sent test email to personal inbox
- [ ] Verified rendering in dark mode email client
- [ ] Verified rendering on mobile (iOS Mail or Gmail app)
- [ ] Read the entire email aloud — does it sound like a peer talking to a peer?
- [ ] The subject line makes you want to open it, even on a busy Tuesday morning
- [ ] If you received this from someone else, would you forward it to your CTO?

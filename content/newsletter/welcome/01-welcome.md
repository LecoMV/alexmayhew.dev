Subject: Welcome to The Architect's Brief (+ what to expect)

Hey {first_name},

Thanks for subscribing. You just joined a group of CTOs, VPs of Engineering, and senior technical leaders who care about making better architecture decisions — not chasing hype cycles.

Here's what you signed up for:

- **One email every Tuesday.** A single architectural decision, broken down with specific numbers, business context, and a clear framework for when to apply it.
- **No fluff.** Every issue is 500-700 words. You'll read it in under 5 minutes. If I don't have something worth saying, I don't send.
- **Real advisory experience.** I work with startups and scale-ups as a Technical Advisor. The patterns I share come from actual engagements — not blog post aggregation.

## Start Here

If you want a sense of how I think about architecture decisions, these three guides are the foundation:

1. **[SaaS Architecture Decision Framework](https://alexmayhew.dev/blog/saas-architecture-decision-framework)** — Maps every critical architecture choice to revenue milestones, from $0 to $1M+ ARR. This is the guide I wish existed when I built my first multi-tenant platform.

2. **[Performance Engineering Playbook](https://alexmayhew.dev/blog/performance-engineering-playbook)** — Why 100ms of latency costs you 1% in conversions, and the systematic approach to fixing it. Covers Core Web Vitals, database optimization, and caching strategies that compound.

3. **[AI-Assisted Development Guide](https://alexmayhew.dev/blog/ai-assisted-development-guide)** — Where AI actually accelerates engineering (and where it creates expensive technical debt). The build-vs-buy matrix I use with clients evaluating LLM integration.

One quick favor — add `alex@alexmayhew.dev` to your contacts. It keeps future emails out of spam and promotions tabs.

Hit reply and tell me: what's the biggest technical decision on your plate right now? I read every response, and it helps me write issues that matter to you.

P.S. I'm not a blogger — I'm a Technical Advisor who writes about the patterns I see across engagements. If you're curious about how that works, I'll share more in a few days.

Subject: Quick question (2 weeks in)

Hey {first_name},

You've been reading The Architect's Brief for two weeks now. Before I keep sending you architecture decisions every Tuesday, I want to make sure I'm covering what matters to you.

**Quick question:** Which of these topics is most relevant to your work right now?

- **Architecture decisions** — monolith vs. microservices, service extraction, system design
- **Performance engineering** — Core Web Vitals, database optimization, caching strategies
- **Scaling teams** — first hires, IC-to-lead transitions, technical hiring
- **AI/ML integration** — when to build vs. buy, LLM architecture, cost optimization

Hit reply with one of those (or something else entirely). It takes 10 seconds and directly shapes what I write about.

Here's a quick insight while I have you — something that came up in a client conversation this week:

**The 80/20 rule of database optimization.** Before you add Redis, before you tune your queries, before you add read replicas — check your indexes. In 80% of the performance reviews I do, the single highest-impact fix is adding or correcting a missing composite index. The typical improvement: 10-50x query speedup for 10 minutes of work.

That's it. Short email this week.

– Alex

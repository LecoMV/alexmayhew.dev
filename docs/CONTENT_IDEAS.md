## Blog Post Idea: "Any Development Pattern Is Better Than Two"

**Source:** Jack Danger's "Technical Coherence" article (https://jackdanger.com/technical-coherence)

**Core concept:** The cost of having two ways to do something (two ORMs, two auth systems, two deployment patterns) almost always exceeds the cost of the "wrong" single choice. Decision fatigue, onboarding friction, maintenance burden, and tribal knowledge fragmentation compound over time.

**Angle for Alex's voice:**

- Architecture advisory perspective — real examples of teams paying the tax of "we'll support both for now"
- Connects to "boring technology" thesis
- Could tie into multi-tenancy post (one RLS pattern vs. mixed approaches)
- Potential spoke for `saas-architecture` hub

**Working title options:**

- "Any Development Pattern Is Better Than Two"
- "The Hidden Tax of 'We Support Both'"
- "Why One Bad Choice Beats Two Good Ones"

## Social Calendar Alignment

### LinkedIn (4 posts/week, Mon-Thu at 10:00 AM EST / 15:00 UTC)

Every blog post generates 4 LinkedIn posts per week. Non-blog weeks use repurposed content from the existing 44-post blog library.

- **Monday:** Architecture/strategy post (contrarian hook + evidence)
- **Tuesday:** Framework/decision post (specific numbers, cost analysis)
- **Wednesday:** Leadership/hiring post (experience lens)
- **Thursday:** Technical deep-dive or AI/performance post

Format: 1,000-1,300 chars, no hashtags, no links in body, ends with specific question.

### X/Twitter (3 posts/week, Tue/Wed/Thu at 12:00 PM EST / 17:00 UTC)

Standalone tweets from blog insights. Different angle than LinkedIn — punchier, more direct.

Format: Under 280 chars, no links (270% reach penalty), no hashtags, standalone insights.

### Dev.to (bi-weekly, Monday at 9:00 AM EST)

Full cross-post of blog content with canonical URL back to alexmayhew.dev.

### Current Schedule

**Batch 1 (Feb 9 - Mar 6, 2026):** 16 LinkedIn + 13 X + 4 Dev.to = 33 posts. Generated from existing blog library.

**Batch 2 (Mar 9 - Oct 8, 2026):** 64 LinkedIn + 48 X + 8 Dev.to = 120 posts. Pre-generated for all 16 drafted blog posts. Social content files in `content/social/`. SQL insert script: `content/social/postiz-bulk-insert.sql`.

**Total queued:** 164 posts covering Feb 4 through Oct 8, 2026.

### Social Content Files

| `content/social/saas-architecture.md`       | SaaS Architecture       | 2     | 8        | 6   | 2      |

### Pipeline

```
Blog push to main
  → n8n webhook → Ollama (Gemma 2 9B) generates variants
  → Claude reviews/rewrites for voice compliance
  → Postiz API schedules to correct day/time
```

For the 16 batch posts, social content was pre-generated by Claude (bypassing Gemma 2 9B) and bulk-inserted directly via SQL. See `docs/CONTENT_REPURPOSING_SYSTEM.md` for generation templates and prompts.

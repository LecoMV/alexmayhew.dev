## alexmayhew.dev - Technical Advisor Marketing Plan

> **Created:** 2026-01-27
> **Goal:** Generate qualified, organic traffic and convert to consulting leads
> **Timeline:** 90-day sprint with 6-12 month compounding

---

## Executive Summary

### The Reality Check

- **SEO delivers 748% ROI** ($7.48 per $1 spent) - highest of all channels
- **77.5% of B2B buyers share content through "dark social"** (Slack, WhatsApp, email DMs)
- **6-12 months** before meaningful SEO results; first leads typically at 4-6 months
- **70% of consultants** get 0 leads/month from their website - your network matters most initially

### Platform Priority Matrix

| Platform          | Priority       | Why                                                     | Time Investment |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **LinkedIn**      | P0 (Must Have) | 62% of B2B leads, 229-388% ROI                          | 5 hrs/week      |
| **X (Twitter)**   | P1 (Important) | Thought leadership, tech community                      | 3 hrs/week      |
| **Hacker News**   | P1 (Important) | Technical credibility, traffic spikes                   | 2 hrs/week      |
| **Bluesky**       | P2 (Emerging)  | Early adoption opportunity, 40M→100M users              | 1 hr/week       |
| **Slack/Discord** | P2 (Important) | Direct access to decision-makers                        | 3 hrs/week      |
| **Facebook**      | ❌ SKIP        | 20-30% cost increase, 1/3 to 1/10 LinkedIn's conversion | 0               |

### Facebook Verdict

**Skip Facebook entirely for organic.** Research shows:

- Being cut from B2B marketing budgets industry-wide
- 1/3 to 1/10 of LinkedIn's conversion rates for B2B
- 20-30% cost increase with declining results
- Only potential use: Paid ads for retargeting (future consideration)

## Platform-Specific Strategies

### 1. LinkedIn (P0 - Your Primary Channel)

**Why It Matters:** 62% of B2B leads come from LinkedIn. Decision-makers live here.

#### Content Strategy

**Posting Frequency:** 3-5x per week (quality > quantity)

**Best Times:** Tuesday-Thursday, 10 AM - 12 PM (your timezone)

**Content Mix:**

- 40% - Educational insights (technical decisions, architecture patterns)
- 30% - Case studies and project learnings (anonymized if needed)
- 20% - Industry commentary and trends
- 10% - Direct offers/CTAs (max)

**Top Performing Formats (2026):**

1. **Carousels** (8-15 slides) - Highest engagement
2. **PDF documents** - Technical deep dives
3. **Text posts with line breaks** - Easy to read
4. **Polls** - Drive engagement, gather insights
5. **Video** (under 2 min) - Personal connection

#### Content Repurposing Framework

Turn each blog post into:

```
1 Blog Post →
  ├── 1 LinkedIn carousel (key points as slides)
  ├── 1 LinkedIn text post (150-300 words, 3 takeaways)
  ├── 1 Twitter thread (8-12 tweets)
  ├── 1 Newsletter section
  └── 1 Short video (optional, 2-3 min)
```

#### Engagement Tactics

**Daily (15-20 min):**

- Comment on 5-10 posts from target audience (CTOs, founders)
- Respond to all comments on your posts within 2 hours
- Share 1-2 others' content with thoughtful commentary

**Weekly:**

- Connect with 20-30 target prospects (personalized notes)
- Engage with content from people you want to work with
- Check LinkedIn notifications and respond to DMs

#### Profile Optimization Checklist

- [ ] Headline: "Technical Advisor | I help [target] solve [problem]"
- [ ] Banner: Professional, shows what you do
- [ ] About: Problem → Solution → Proof → CTA
- [ ] Featured: Best case studies, lead magnets
- [ ] Experience: Results-focused, not task-focused
- [ ] Recommendations: Ask 3-5 past clients

---

### 2. X (Twitter) Strategy

**Why It Matters:** Tech community lives here. Thought leadership builds authority.

#### Content Strategy

**Posting Frequency:** 1-3x per day

**Best Times:** Weekdays 9 AM - 4 PM

**Content Types:**

- Technical insights and hot takes
- Thread breakdowns of complex topics
- Commentary on tech news
- Behind-the-scenes of consulting work
- Engagement with other tech voices

#### Thread Strategy

**High-performing thread formula:**

```
Tweet 1: Hook (controversial take or surprising insight)
Tweets 2-10: Value delivery (one point per tweet)
Tweet 11: Summary + CTA
Tweet 12: "If you found this valuable, follow for more on [topic]"
```

**Topics that perform well:**

- "I've reviewed 50+ SaaS codebases. Here's what separates the good from the great:"
- "Why [popular thing] is wrong for [specific use case]"
- "The real cost of [common technical decision]"
- Technical decision frameworks
- Migration war stories

#### Engagement Rules

- Reply to comments within 1 hour when possible
- Quote tweet interesting content with your take
- Build relationships with other tech voices (genuine engagement)
- Don't just post—participate in conversations

---

### 3. Hacker News Strategy

**Why It Matters:** Technical credibility. Front page = 10K+ visitors in 24 hours.

#### The Rules (Critical)

**DO:**

- Submit genuinely interesting technical content
- Participate in discussions with substantive comments
- Share insights from real experience
- Be intellectually honest

**DON'T:**

- Use marketing language (instant death)
- Self-promote aggressively
- Submit your own content too frequently
- Argue or get defensive

#### Submission Strategy

**Best content to submit:**

- Technical blog posts with genuine insights
- Open source tools you've built
- Interesting technical decisions/trade-offs
- Industry analysis with data

**Timing:** Submit at 6-9 AM Pacific (HN peak hours)

**Title formula:** Descriptive, no clickbait, no ALL CAPS

#### Comment Strategy

**Build karma first:**

- Comment thoughtfully on technical discussions
- Share relevant experience without self-promotion
- Ask good questions
- Provide helpful answers

**After building reputation:**

- Occasionally share your own content (1 in 10 submissions max)
- Reference your site only when genuinely relevant
- Let others discover your work through your comments

---

### 4. Bluesky Strategy

**Why It Matters:** Early adoption opportunity. Growing from 40M to 75-100M users by end of 2026.

#### Opportunity

- Less saturated than Twitter
- Tech-forward early adopters
- Algorithm favors engagement over follower count
- Good time to build audience before it gets crowded

#### Content Approach

- Mirror your Twitter strategy
- Cross-post high-performing Twitter content
- Engage with the tech community forming there
- Build presence now for future leverage

---

### 5. Slack & Discord Communities

**Why It Matters:** Direct access to decision-makers. Build real relationships.

#### Top Communities to Join

- **90% of activity** = Genuine participation (answering questions, sharing insights)
- **10% of activity** = Thoughtful self-promotion

**Build trust for 2-4 weeks** before ANY promotional content.

#### Engagement Strategy

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)**

- Answer 3-5 questions daily
- Never mention your services

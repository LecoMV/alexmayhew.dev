## Content Pillars

1. **Architecture Decisions** - When to choose X over Y
2. **Migration Strategies** - Modernizing legacy systems
3. **Performance Deep-Dives** - Database, caching, scaling
4. **SaaS Patterns** - Multi-tenancy, billing, auth
5. **Contrarian Takes** - Why popular advice is wrong

- **Technical deep-dives** on alexmayhew.dev blog
- **Curated links** from HN, dev.to, engineering blogs
- **Tool reviews** tested in real projects

### Subject Line Formulas That Work

**Pattern 1: Specific Problem**

- "Your database queries are slow. Here's why."
- "That Next.js pattern is costing you $500/month"
- "PostgreSQL RLS isn't enough for multi-tenancy"

**Pattern 2: Contrarian Take**

- "Stop using Redis for everything"

**Pattern 3: Framework/Number**

- "The 3-tier architecture decision I use for every SaaS"
- "5 migration patterns that actually work"
- "The only 2 caching strategies you need"

**What to Avoid:**

- "Newsletter #42" (boring)
- "Weekly Update" (generic)
- All caps, excessive punctuation
- Spam triggers: "free," "limited time," "act now"

## Growth Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)

**Goal:** 0 → 1,000 subscribers

**Tactics:**

1. **Blog integration** - Signup form on every blog post
2. **LinkedIn posts** - Tease newsletter content weekly
3. **Twitter threads** - Weekly thread → newsletter CTA
4. **Signature** - Add to email signature
5. **Existing network** - Personal outreach to past clients/colleagues

**Signup Placements:**

- Hero section of homepage
- Inline in blog posts (after first valuable section)
- End of every blog post
- Exit-intent popup (optional, test)
- Footer on every page

### Phase 2: Growth (Months 3-6)

**Goal:** 1,000 → 5,000 subscribers

**Tactics:**

1. **Referral program** - "Forward to a colleague" + incentive
2. **Cross-promotions** - Partner with complementary newsletters
3. **Guest posts** - Write for established dev publications
4. **Lead magnet** - "SaaS Architecture Decision Framework" PDF
5. **Webinars** - Monthly technical deep-dive with signup

**Referral Incentives:**

- 1 referral: Shoutout in newsletter
- 3 referrals: Access to private Slack channel
- 5 referrals: 30-min architecture review call
- 10 referrals: Mention in annual "Top Referrers" issue

### Phase 3: Conversion (Months 6-12)

**Goal:** 5,000 → 10,000 subscribers + consulting pipeline

**Tactics:**

1. **Case study CTA** - End high-performing issues with consultation offer
2. **Content upgrade** - Gated in-depth guides
3. **Testimonials** - Include client success stories
4. **Multi-level CTAs** - Different asks for different trust levels
5. **Welcome sequence** - 5-email onboarding series

---

## CTA Strategy

### The Trust Ladder

**Low Commitment (Months 1-3):**

- "Hit reply and tell me about your current stack"
- "Forward this to a colleague who'd find it useful"
- "Check out my detailed blog post on [topic]"

**Medium Commitment (Months 3-6):**

- "Download my SaaS Architecture Decision Framework (PDF)"
- "Join my free monthly architecture office hours"
- "Read the full case study on alexmayhew.dev"

**High Commitment (Months 6+):**

- "Book a free 30-minute architecture review"
- "Let's talk about your modernization project"
- "Spots open for Q2 advisory engagements"

### CTA Placement Rules

1. **ONE primary CTA** per issue (feels conversational)
2. **Place after value delivery** (trust is highest)
3. **P.S. line** for secondary/softer CTA
4. **Never lead with promotion** (value first, always)

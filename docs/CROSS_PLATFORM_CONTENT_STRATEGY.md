## The Core Principle: One Brain, Three Voices

You are NOT posting the same content in three places. You are running three distinct operations that share source material but serve different strategic purposes:

| Platform       | Strategic Role                                   | Audience State                       | Content Mode                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Blog**       | Authority anchor. SEO. Evergreen value.          | Searching for answers                | Deep, comprehensive, reference-grade               |
| **Newsletter** | Trust builder. Direct relationship.              | Opted in, expects value              | Curated insight, decision frameworks               |
| **LinkedIn**   | Professional credibility. Inbound leads.         | Passive browsing, business context   | Distilled authority, conversation starters         |
| **X/Twitter**  | Technical credibility. Community building.       | Active engagement, technical context | Sharp takes, specific replies, pattern recognition |
| **Dev.to**     | SEO backlinks. Developer trust. Technical reach. | Looking for tutorials/guides         | Full technical depth, code-forward                 |

**The funnel:** X reply or LinkedIn post catches attention. Profile links to blog. Blog captures email. Newsletter builds trust. Trust becomes advisory work. You never pitch. They come to you.

## What Goes Where: The Content Matrix

### Same Source, Different Asset

Every blog post generates platform-native derivatives. But they are NOT reformatted copies. Each derivative is built for its platform's native consumption pattern:

| Source: Blog Post                             | LinkedIn                                                               | X/Twitter                                                        | Dev.to                                                       | Newsletter                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3,000-word architecture deep dive             | 1,200-char business insight with specific numbers. Ends with question. | 8-tweet thread: one sharp insight per tweet. Tweet 1 standalone. | Full article with code examples. Canonical URL back to blog. | 500-word decision framework: "When to use this, when not to." |
| **Angle:** Why this matters for your business | **Angle:** The business outcome                                        | **Angle:** The technical pattern                                 | **Angle:** The implementation                                | **Angle:** The decision criteria                              |

### Platform-Exclusive Content

Some content ONLY lives on one platform. This is critical for making each channel worth following independently:

| Platform       | Exclusive Content                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **LinkedIn**   | Replies to CTO/VP posts. Real-time engagement with industry conversations. Personal advisory observations ("Three CTOs this month asked me the same question..."). |
| **X/Twitter**  | Hot takes under 280 chars. Real-time technical replies. Community posts. Quote tweets adding the meta-insight. War stories in thread format.                       |
| **Dev.to**     | Tutorial-format content with full code samples. Hands-on implementation guides that are too code-heavy for the blog.                                               |
| **Newsletter** | Subscriber-only decision frameworks. "The question I'd ask" analysis. Retrospectives on past advice and whether it held up.                                        |

### Content That Should NEVER Cross Platforms

| Don't Do This                                  | Why                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| LinkedIn post on X verbatim                    | LinkedIn voice is business-formal. X voice is sharp and technical. The overlap audience notices. |
| X thread on LinkedIn verbatim                  | Thread format reads wrong on LinkedIn. The "1/" convention is X-native.                          |
| Blog intro as a social post                    | Blog intros are optimized for "keep reading." Social needs to deliver value in the post itself.  |
| Same hot take on both X and LinkedIn same week | The 15% audience overlap sees repetition. Stagger by 2+ weeks if reusing a take.                 |

## Platform-Specific Playbooks

### LinkedIn — The Authority Engine

**Current state:** Growing. Active engagement. Inbound conversations happening.
**Goal:** Positioned as the technical advisor CTOs think of first.

**Content Formula:**

```
Hook (bold claim or surprising number)
↓
Context (2-3 short paragraphs, business framing)
↓
Insight (the thing only someone with experience would know)
↓
Question (specific, invites the right audience to comment)
```

**Weekly cadence:**

- Wednesday: Blog-derived post (1,200-1,300 chars, distilled business insight)
- Friday: Standalone observation or repurposed newsletter insight
- Daily: 3-5 thoughtful replies on CTO/VP Engineering posts

**What works:**

- Specific numbers ("$500K mistake", "10x cost", "40-60% of year one")
- Contrarian takes backed by experience ("Your startup doesn't need Kubernetes")
- The "I've seen this pattern" framework (advisory lens, not preaching)
- Questions that filter for CTOs ("What's the most expensive architecture decision you've made?")

**What doesn't:**

- Links in post body (algorithm buries them)
- Generic career advice
- Agreeing with everyone (no edge = no engagement)
- Posts over 1,300 chars (engagement drops)

**Engagement rules:**

- Reply to comments on your posts within 2 hours
- Reply to target audience posts daily (CTOs, VPs, founders)
- Never pitch services in comments
- Add value that makes them visit your profile

---

### X/Twitter — The Technical Credibility Lab

**Current state:** New account (~1 follower). Zero algorithm history. Building from scratch.
**Goal:** Technical community respects the voice. Replies get noticed. Communities amplify reach.

**Phase 1: Engagement-First (Weeks 1-8, current phase)**

| Activity                                  | Time   | Priority |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| Thoughtful replies on 5-10 relevant posts | 70-80% | Critical |
| Community posts                           | 15-20% | High     |
| Original tweets                           | 5-10%  | Low      |

**Reply strategy (this is the growth engine):**

- Find posts from @GergelyOrosz, @mjovanovictech, @simonhoiberg, architecture/SaaS accounts
- Write replies that add what they didn't say (not "great post")
- 2-4 sentences. Specific. Experience-backed. One insight per reply.
- Replies are worth 150x likes for algorithm credibility

**Community strategy (the visibility hack):**

- Post original content INSIDE Communities first (Build in Public, Indie Hackers, Tech Startups)
- Community posts appear in Community feeds regardless of follower count
- 2026 algorithm change: Community posts now surface in For You feed for non-members
- Post 100% of original content to Communities until 3K-5K followers

**Phase 2: Balanced (Weeks 9-20, ~100+ followers)**

| Activity                | Time   | Priority           |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Replies                 | 50-60% | Still critical     |
| Community posts         | 20-30% | Main growth driver |
| Original tweets/threads | 20-30% | Building library   |

**Phase 3: Authority (Week 20+, ~500+ followers)**

| Activity         | Time   | Priority                 |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| Original content | 40-50% | Primary                  |
| Replies          | 30-40% | Relationship maintenance |
| Community posts  | 10-20% | Cross-promotion          |

**X content formats:**

1. **Hot take (single tweet, <280 chars):**

   > The most expensive infrastructure decision isn't choosing the wrong tool. It's choosing the right tool at the wrong stage.

2. **Thread (8-12 tweets, blog-derived):**
   - Tweet 1: Standalone hook (no "Thread:" or "1/")
   - Tweets 2-7: One concrete insight each
   - Tweet 8: Summary + blog link

3. **Quote tweet (adding the meta-insight):**
   - Take someone's specific claim
   - Add the "but here's what nobody mentions" layer

4. **Community post (longer format, 1000+ chars):**
   - Full mini-essay format
   - Technical depth appropriate for the community
   - Ends with a question or framework

**X voice (different from LinkedIn):**

- Sharper. More technical. Less formal.
- OK to use sentence fragments
- Numbers and specifics still mandatory
- "I" perspective, not "we"
- No hashtags (algorithm no longer boosts them in 2026)
- No emojis (brand rule)

---

### Dev.to — The SEO & Developer Trust Channel

**Current state:** Cross-posting from blog via Postiz automation.
**Goal:** Backlinks to alexmayhew.dev. Developer audience exposure. Technical credibility with implementation crowd.

**Content strategy:**

- Every blog post becomes a Dev.to article (automated via n8n)
- ALWAYS set canonical URL to alexmayhew.dev (preserves SEO authority)
- Dev.to versions include MORE code than the blog version
- Dev.to-exclusive: hands-on tutorials, "how I built X" walkthroughs

**Dev.to-specific optimizations:**

- Add code blocks early (Dev.to readers scan for code first)
- Tags matter: use up to 4 (e.g., `architecture`, `saas`, `typescript`, `devops`)
- Series feature: link Dev.to articles in a series matching blog hub clusters
- Engage in Dev.to comments (the community rewards responsiveness)

**Cadence:**

- Bi-weekly: Blog-derived article (auto via n8n, Monday 9 AM)
- Monthly: 1 Dev.to-exclusive tutorial (optional, when capacity allows)

---

### Newsletter — The Trust Compounder

**Current state:** Active. Weekly cadence. Listmonk self-hosted.
**Goal:** The channel where advisory relationships start. Subscribers trust you before they ever email you.

**Content strategy:**

- Week A: Features the blog post's core insight (decision framework format)
- Week B: Standalone insight not available anywhere else (subscriber-exclusive value)
- Every issue: 500-700 words. One clear insight. One actionable framework.

**What makes newsletter different:**

- More personal voice (still authoritative, but slightly more "here's what I'm seeing")
- Decision frameworks subscribers can apply immediately
- Retrospectives ("6 months ago I recommended X. Here's what actually happened.")
- Subscriber-only depth on topics covered briefly on social

## The Integrated Weekly Calendar

### Week A (Blog Week)

| Day       | Blog             | Newsletter                    | LinkedIn              | X/Twitter                           | Dev.to             |

### Week B (Newsletter-Only Week)

| Day       | Blog | Newsletter       | LinkedIn               | X/Twitter                           | Dev.to |
| --------- | ---- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Mon**   | —    | —                | —                      | —                                   | —      |

| **Wed**   | —    | —                | Repurposed post        | —                                   | —      |
| **Thu**   | —    | —                | —                      | Repurposed take or reply-focused    | —      |
| **Fri**   | —    | —                | Text post (repurposed) | —                                   | —      |
| **Daily** | —    | —                | 3-5 replies            | 5-10 replies + Community engagement | —      |

**Key insight:** Daily engagement (replies) happens EVERY day regardless of Week A or B. The automated posts handle distribution. The manual work is engagement.

## Content Flow: How Platforms Feed Each Other

```
Blog Post (2,000-5,000 words)
├── Newsletter insight (500-700 words, decision framework)
├── LinkedIn post (1,200 chars, business angle)
├── X thread (8-12 tweets, technical angle)
├── X hot take (280 chars, sharpest contrarian take)
├── Dev.to article (full post + extra code examples)
└── LinkedIn text post (different angle, 150-300 words)

X Replies (daily engagement)
├── Build algorithm credibility → your posts get shown more
├── Drive profile visits → they see your pinned tweet → blog link
└── Build relationships → DMs → advisory conversations

LinkedIn Replies (daily engagement)
├── Build credibility in CTO feeds → your posts get shown more
├── Drive profile visits → they see your experience → blog link
└── Build relationships → connection requests → inbound inquiries

Community Posts (X Communities)
├── Guaranteed visibility regardless of follower count
├── Build engagement history → algorithm starts showing your tweets
└── Cross-pollinate with main feed as follower count grows
```

**The virtuous cycle:**

1. Blog establishes depth
2. Social derivatives create discovery
3. Replies build relationships and algorithm credibility
4. Newsletter captures the interested
5. Newsletter builds trust over weeks/months
6. Trust converts to "Can you advise on our architecture?"
7. Advisory work generates new stories/insights for the blog

**You never sell. You demonstrate. The work sells itself.**

## Voice Calibration by Platform

The same insight, expressed natively for each platform:

### Topic: "Microservices are premature for most startups"

**Blog:**

> Microservices require a minimum of 12 supporting systems before they deliver value: service mesh, distributed tracing, service discovery, circuit breakers, API gateways, centralized logging, container orchestration, CI/CD per service, schema registries, health checking, config management, and secret rotation. For teams under 50 engineers, that's infrastructure tax without infrastructure scale. The transition point—when the monolith genuinely constrains delivery—typically arrives between $5-10M ARR or 15+ engineers, not before.

**LinkedIn:**

> I've advised 12 startups in the past year. Every one that started with microservices regretted it by month 6.
>
> Not because microservices are bad. Because they require 12+ supporting systems before they deliver value—service mesh, tracing, discovery, circuit breakers—before you ship a single feature.
>
> The transition point: $5-10M ARR or 15+ engineers. Not before.
>
> The cost of premature microservices isn't just infrastructure spend. It's the 6 months your team spent on plumbing instead of product.
>
> What's the most expensive "best practice" you've seen adopted too early?

**X (single tweet):**

> Microservices require 12 supporting systems before they deliver value. For teams under 50 engineers, that's infrastructure tax without infrastructure scale. The monolith transition point: $5-10M ARR or 15+ engineers.

**X (thread, tweet 1):**

> I've watched startups burn through $400K in infra before shipping a single feature. The cause: microservices at 5 engineers.

**X (Community post):**

> Building something right now? Here's a decision framework I use with every startup I advise:
>
> Under 50 engineers = monolith. Period.
> Under $5M ARR = monolith. Period.
> The "but we'll need to scale" argument has killed more startups than any monolith ever has.
>
> The 12 systems you need before microservices deliver value: service mesh, distributed tracing, service discovery, circuit breakers, API gateway, centralized logging, container orchestration, CI/CD per service, schema registry, health checking, config management, secret rotation.
>
> If your team can't name all 12 from memory, you're not ready.
>
> What's your current architecture? Monolith or micro?

**Dev.to:**

> Full article with the above plus PostgreSQL schema examples, Docker Compose vs. Kubernetes comparison, actual migration patterns with code, and a "Decision Checklist" section with a concrete scoring rubric.

**Newsletter:**

> This week I want to share a framework I use in every advisory engagement: the microservices readiness assessment. It's 5 questions. If you can't answer "yes" to all 5, the monolith is the right call. [500 words with the 5 questions and what each "no" means]

## Engagement Strategy: The "Hunted Not Hunter" Playbook

### What "Hunted Not Hunter" Actually Means

| Hunter Behavior                     | Hunted Behavior                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Hire me for architecture advice"   | Share an insight so specific they screenshot it              |
| DM people offering services         | Reply to their post with the answer they needed              |
| Post about your availability        | Post about the pattern you just saw in 3 client engagements  |
| "Check out my blog"                 | Write a reply so good they check your profile voluntarily    |
| LinkedIn connection request + pitch | LinkedIn reply that makes them send YOU a connection request |

### The Inbound Flywheel

**Step 1: Demonstrate (not describe) expertise**

- Every post, reply, and thread should teach something specific
- Use real numbers, real patterns, real frameworks
- The reader should be able to apply the insight immediately

**Step 2: Make your profile the logical next step**

- X bio: Clear positioning + blog link
- LinkedIn headline: "Technical Advisor | I help CTOs avoid $500K mistakes"
- Pinned tweet: Your single best insight (update monthly)
- Blog: Comprehensive, deep, the thing they bookmark

**Step 3: Let the funnel work passively**

- Someone sees your reply → visits profile → clicks blog → reads 3 posts → subscribes to newsletter → after 4-6 issues, emails you: "Do you do consulting?"
- You never asked. They came.

**Step 4: Compound over time**

- Week 1: 0 inbound. Normal.
- Month 1: Maybe 1 DM saying "good insight."
- Month 3: People start tagging you in relevant discussions.
- Month 6: Inbound advisory inquiries start.
- Month 12: You have a waitlist.

### Lagging Indicators (Track Monthly)

| Metric                              | What It Means               |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Inbound DMs about advisory work     | The flywheel is working     |
| Tagged in discussions by others     | You're becoming a reference |
| Newsletter replies (not just opens) | Deep trust building         |
| Blog backlinks from other sites     | SEO authority compounding   |

### Vanity Metrics (Ignore)

- Total follower count (engagement rate matters more)
- Post likes without comments (passive consumption)
- Page views without time-on-page (bounce traffic)

## Implementation: What Changes Right Now

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Fix X/Twitter posting error** — Posts failing with `Unknown Error`. Debug before Feb 11 scheduled post.
2. **Join X Communities** — Build in Public, Indie Hackers, Tech Startups. Start posting inside Communities immediately.
3. **Start daily X engagement** — 5-10 thoughtful replies per day on target accounts. This is the #1 growth lever.
4. **Update X bio and pinned tweet** — Clear positioning, blog link, strongest single insight.

### Short-Term (This Month)

5. **Differentiate auto-generated X content from LinkedIn** — n8n currently generates both from same blog. Update prompts so X output is sharper, more technical, uses X-native voice.
6. **Add Community posting to Postiz schedule** — Original content goes to Communities first, not just main feed.
7. **Create reply templates** — Not canned responses, but frameworks for different reply situations (architecture discussion, AI take, cost question).

### Medium-Term (Next 2 Months)

8. **Dev.to optimization** — Add more code to Dev.to versions. Use Dev.to series feature matching hub clusters.
9. **Newsletter subscriber-exclusive content** — Start adding one decision framework per issue that isn't available on social.
10. **X thread cadence** — Once engagement history is established (~100 followers), start weekly threads from blog posts.

### Ongoing

11. **Daily engagement** — 15-20 min/day: X replies + LinkedIn replies. Non-negotiable.
12. **Weekly content review** — Friday: check what resonated, adjust next week's angles.
13. **Monthly strategy review** — Are we getting inbound? Adjust platform mix if needed.

## The Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

| Anti-Pattern                                | Why It Fails                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Same post everywhere on same day            | Audience overlap notices. Looks lazy.                               |
| Posting only, never engaging                | Algorithm won't show your content. You're yelling into the void.    |
| Pitching in comments/DMs                    | Instantly disqualifies you as "the hunted."                         |
| Engagement pods / "like-for-like" groups    | Algorithm detects artificial engagement. Net negative.              |
| Buying followers                            | Destroys engagement rate. Unrecoverable.                            |
| Posting more than 2x/day on X (early stage) | Dilutes per-post engagement when algorithm hasn't credited you yet. |
| Threads with "Thread:" or "1/" prefix       | Dated convention. Tweet 1 should standalone.                        |
| Using hashtags on X in 2026                 | Algorithm no longer boosts them. Visual clutter.                    |
| Linking to blog in every post               | Looks promotional. Reserve links for threads (last tweet) and bio.  |
| Generic "great post" replies                | Zero algorithm credit. Zero relationship building.                  |

_This strategy turns one brain and two blog posts per month into a multi-platform presence that compounds over time. The automation handles distribution. The manual work is engagement. The goal is not followers — it's becoming the person people think of when they need architecture guidance._
